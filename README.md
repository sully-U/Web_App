# Overview
This is a foundation of a web application made to register a new student. The app uses python and django as a framework.
The app currently runs on your local computer so you will need to uses a few commands in the terminal in order to start the app/server.
* 1) Open a new terminal and change directories until you're in the file location of the app.
* 2) Once in the correct location (ie .../Documents/Foldername/mysite), run the command "python3 manage.py runserver"
(the command might be different depending on if you're using MacOS or Windows)
* 3) If everything goes well, you should see that the server is running. Now, open a browser, and type in the URL bar: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/homepage/"
* 4) From there, you should be able to interact with the app.

# Future Work

* I would like to get the database conected to the website so that in the future, users can login as well as retrieve data
* Using data collected on different courses, I would like to make more webpages that display the data in an attractive and interactive way for students to plan their course schedules better
* Animations and responsive aspects would be a nice touch too!
